About

Hi! I am Oleksii Lialka, MBA, Data Scientist with specialty in financial technology,
quantitative finance, predictive analytics and risk management.
My primary career focus is setting up tailored, enterprise-grade solutions
and R&D for data-driven decision making by leveraging cross-disciplinary analytics,
domain expertise and cutting edge ML/AI technology.

I realised, that there is no open-source solutions for Python to the frictionless
financial statement analysis, not to mention tools for equity research. Back in a days,
when I was a quantitative analyst, I used to do a lot of equity valuation, and I remember
just how tedious and time consuming this process is. I (finally) decided to fill in
this gap by starting the project Equity Valuation Kit or Evkit for short. It is supposed to fill
the gaps in quants' and researchers' toolbox by providing cohesive environment and sound
methodologies for equity research.
